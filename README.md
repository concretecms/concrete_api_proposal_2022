# Concrete CMS API Proposal 2022

Hello there! This is a package for Concrete CMS (9.1.1+) that adds a proposed REST API. This API is reasonably comprehensive: there are certainly many things you won't be able to do with this API that you can do with the full CMS application, but this API should give you significant access to the most important aspects of a Concrete CMS application.
